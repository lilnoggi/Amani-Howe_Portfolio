        <p>During my Year 10 work experience, I had the opportunity to work with my uncle who is a game dev.
            Here, I saw what it was like to be working in a professional development environment.
        I would also like to note his game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1559680/Amazing_Frog_2/" >Amazing Frog?</a> and the Studio name <a href="https://www.fayju.com/blog/">Fayju.</a></p>

        <p>I wanted to join a game jam to develop my skills. I found a team with another programmer, two artists, and a composer.
            The theme is "Light is dangerous" and we are all working together to build something new, fun, and interesting!
