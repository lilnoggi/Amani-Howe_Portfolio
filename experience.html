        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-dice"></i></i>Project: Text Based Adventure Game (Console App)</h3>
        <p>Make a branching story game in the console where the player makes choices that affect the outcome. 
            Think of a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style game!</p>
            <h2><strong><i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i>What I Learned:</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Classes & Objects</li>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                <li>String manipulation</li>
                <li>Flow controls (if/else/switch)</li>
                <li>Loops</li>
                <li>User input/output</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong><i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>Bonus Ideas:</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a health system</li>
                <li>Add a save/load feauture</li>
                <li>Random Events (using <i>Random</i>)</li>
                <li>ASCII art scenes</li>
                <li>Build the console app into Unity later</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><u><i class="fa-solid fa-code-branch"></i>Developing The Story</u></h3>
            <h4><strong>Premise & Goal</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sam rescues friends</strong> (Mani, Erin and Summer) who are trapped in the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Escape the game</strong> (but there's a catch - maybe escaping means something dangerous will happen or it will erase someone important)</li>
                <li><strong>Solve the mystery</strong> of the games creator or what caused the game to malfunction leading to Sams entrapment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong><i class="fa-regular fa-id-card"></i>Characters and Motivation</strong></h3>
            <p>Develop Sam's relationships with his friends</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sam's role:</strong> is he the hero who will save everyone or does he have doubts and insecurities?</li>
                <li><strong>Erin, Mani and Summer:</strong> What are their personalities like in this world? Do they need rescueing or do they have their own objectives and quests that intersect with Sam's?</li>
                <li><strong>The villain:</strong> who or what is behind the digital trap? Is it corrupted AI, a vengeful hacker, or even someone Sam knows who's turned against him? The antagonists motivations should drive much of the conflict.</li>
            <p>Each character could have their own story arc, and Sam could make decisions that affect their fates.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong><i class="fa-solid fa-folder-tree"></i>Story Beats and Structure</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li></strong>Introduction:</strong> Sam wakes up in the digital world and learns the basic rules (what he can and can't do)</li>
                <li><strong>First mission:</strong> Maybe Sam learns that he has to find a key item (like the crystal) which leads him to the first big choice/twist</li>
                <li><strong>Rising Tension:</strong> Introduce conflicts like encounters with enemies, challenges or strange phenomena that make Sam doubt what's real. Surreal/dream-like sequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Midpoint:</strong> Sam learns something huge: maybe his friends are not as they seem or there is a darker force at play.</li>
                <li><strong>Climax:</strong> A final confrontation or series of choices that will determine who gets out and what happens to the world Sam is in.</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The outcome of the story based on player choices. Do they escape? What happens to their friendships? Do they uncover the truth?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3><strong><i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i>Themes & Conflict</strong></h3>
            <p>Every story needs conflict. Develop <strong>internal conflict</strong> such as Sam's doubts, fear of failure etc. as well as <strong>external conflicts</strong> such as the vilain, the broken game world, or dangerous enemies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><i class="fa-solid fa-user-large-slash"></i>Personal Conflicts:</strong> Sam could struggle with doubts about whether he's even capable of saving his friends or whether he'll be trapped forever.</li>
            <li><strong>Game World Conflicts:</strong> The digital world itself could have glitches or unpredictable events, like the appearance of strange NPCs or dangerous creatues that seem to be controlled by something - or someone-else.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><i class="fa-regular fa-sun"></i>Atmosphere</strong></h3>
        <p>A strong atmosphere can make a text-based game feel immersive. Use descriptive writing to bring the world to life. Describe the <strong>digital environment</strong>—is it a mix of familiar and strange elements? Maybe some places look like normal game worlds, while others are glitchy and corrupted.</p>
        <h3><strong><i class="fa-solid fa-film"></i>Plot Framework</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>The Digital Trap:</strong> Sam, an average gamer, gets sucked into a game while playing. At first, it's a dream come true, but he soon realises that he's not alone - his friends, Mani, Erin and Summer are also trapped, each in different parts of the game world. They've been changed by the game, some of them for the better, and some for the worst.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Objectives:</strong> Sam has to uncover why he's stuck in the game and how to free his friends. Along the way, he discovers that the game's creator, a mysterious figure, is hiding secrets and manipulating the world around him.</li>
            <li><strong>Plot Twists:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Some characters may have hidden motives (Summer, who seems sweet, is hiding a dark secret).</li>
                <li>Sam discovers a choice that could free him, but it may cause something worse to happen to his friends.</li>
                <li>The game's world is unstable, and it's clear that the reality Sam's trying to escape might be more dangerous than staying trapped.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Game Tester/ Helper Fayju (2015)</h3>
        <h4>Testing gameplay, researching, learning the basics of Unity and C#.</h4>
        <p>During my Year 10 work experience, I had the opportunity to work with my uncle who is a game dev.
            Here, I saw what it was like to be working in a professional development environment.
        I would also like to note his game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1559680/Amazing_Frog_2/" >Amazing Frog?</a> and the Studio name <a href="https://www.fayju.com/blog/">Fayju.</a></p>
