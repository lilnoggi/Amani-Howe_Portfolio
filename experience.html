           Sam, Summer, Erin and myself.<br>These friends have always been there to support me with anything I do
            and I am so grateful to have met them. Recently, one of them was diagnosed with cancer.<br>I had also 
            been trying to come up with a project I could dig into and thought this would be a good opportunity to
             do for my friend. Summer, Erin and I are working together to build this game for Sam to show him 
             that he is a hero to us!</p>

        <h4>Testing gameplay, researching, learning the basics of Unity and C#.</h4>
        <p>During my Year 10 work experience, I worked alongside my uncle — an indie developer at Fayju,
          known for Amazing Frog?. I contributed by playtesting, giving feedback, learning Unity and the basics of C#.
          This experience gave me my first insight into professional game development and inspired me to keep learning.</p>
