        <h4><strong>Main Characters:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sam</strong> - Protagonist (player character)</li>
            <li><strong>Erin</strong> - Friend (creative, funny)</li>
            <li><strong>Mani</strong> - Friend (funny and grounded)</li>
            <li><strong>Summer</strong> - Innocent friend with a darker twist</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Plot Summary</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Friends get sucked into a mysterious game</li>
            <li>Each level plays differently and warps their reality</li>
            <li>Sam slowly realises the game is more than it seems</li>
            <li>The group must try to escape, but multiple outcomes are possible</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br>Sam Briggs, a charming and funny 27-year-old YouTuber, spends most of his days streaming games, making reaction videos, and vibing online with his best friends ‚Äî Mani, Erin, and Summer. They call themselves The Shayla‚Äôs (a name they never explain and everyone keeps asking about).
            One night the group were watching a video Mani made until, something strange happens. The video glitches out, and the screen pulls them all into their computers...
            Now Sam must fight his way through bizarre ‚ÄúGame Worlds,‚Äù each themed around different genres (platformers, survival horror, rhythm games, even dating sims), to escape back into reality and save his friends from becoming NPCs‚Ä¶ and they get deleted forever.</p>
        <br><h4><strong>Endings:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bad Ending (Default Route):</strong> "No One Escapes"</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Player makes no special choices. Just follows the story straight through.</li>
                <li><strong>Ending Scene:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sam unlocks the cage and frees the "real" Summer</li>
                    <li>Uses a potion to "save" Mani and Erin</li>
                    <li>They exit the mainframe... but the screen glitches, and the same "intro" scene plays again - a loop</li>
                    <li>Sam's final line: <i>"Wait... Haven't we done this before?</i></li>
                    <li>Fade to black</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Bittersweet Ending:</strong> "Sam escapes alone"</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> The player becomes suspicious of Summer and doesn't fully trust her</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maybe they skip certain tasks she gives, or attack her during a scripted moment</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Ending Scene:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sam escapes, but Erin and Mani are corrupted/lost data</li>
                    <li>Summer is revealed to be partially a vistim - she wasn't fully in control</li>
                    <li>Sam wakes up at his desk... Alone. The others never made it out.</li>
                    <li>A folder appears on his desktop: <strong>SHAYLA_RECOVERY_01</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>True Ending:</strong> "Everyone escapes" (Secret Unlock)</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Player has to do hidden objectives across levels. For Example:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collect "glitch memory fragments" (one per level)</li>
                    <li>Refuse certain "fake" tasks (like Summer's suspicious ones)</li>
                    <li>Use terminals to dig into hidden logs - uncover the game's true purpose/</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Ending Scene:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                <li>Sam uploads the real recovery file from Level 5's terminal</li>
                <li>Inside the cage is not just Summer - it's also backup files for Erin and Mani</li>
                <li>All 4 characters "wake up" together in their room - but something is slightly off<br>(e.g. Pixel flicker in Sam's eye)</li>
                <li><i>Fade out, but the music glitches before it ends</i></li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
                <h2 id="art"><strong>üé®Art & Style</strong></h2>
        <h4><strong>General Style:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Mixed media (Pixel art 2D, styalised 3D)</li>
            <li>Level 1 = Pastel pixel art, cute but unsettling, subtle horror <i>flickering shadows</i></li>
            <li>Level 2 = Grungy sci-fi, DOOM-inspired. Fast-paced, dimly lit spaceship. Colour-coded creamates <i>Among Us</i> but with creepy movement</li>
            <li>Level 3 = Visual novel UI with bright dating sim aesthetics, UI glitches and shifts <i>Doki-Doki Literature Club-style</i></li>
            <li>Level 4 = Dark, eerie horror, fully 3D, realistic lighting, minimal music - tense breathing and ambient sounds</li>
            <li>Level 5 = Cute pixel RPG with twisted undertones, uncanny NPCs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Art Roles:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Erin: Character sprites, tilesets, UI</li>

        <h2><strong>üéµAudio</strong></h2>
        <h4><strong>Style:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Music matches each genre, with subtle horror undertones</li>
            <li>Glitches and reversed sounds to signal game resets or unease</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Footsteps, enemies, gunfire, menu interactions</li>
            <li>Special FX for resets, boss fights, and level interactions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="level"><strong>üß±Level Breakdowns</strong></h2>
        <h4><strong>Level 1 - 2D Platformer (Cats)</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Cute pixel aesthetics</li>
            <li>Fight off dogs & mice</li>
            <li>Meet Summer (acting weird)</li>
            <li>Erin and Mani appear as NPCs</li>
            <li>Game "resets" after enemy wave</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>üïπLevel Design</h3>
        <p>Sam and his friends are turned into cats (inspired by Chonkers).<br>Sam wakes up as a cat in a 2D platformer game. He has to run away from dogs and can attack evil mice with water guns.</p>
        <p><i>When Sam meets Summer (evil version), she is shocked that he is not an "NPC".</i> Sam asks Summer <i>"How did this happen? We are inside a video game!</i> Summer appears shocked then, all of a sudden, a wave of enemies span and Sam has to fight them.<br> After the wave is over, Sam finds Erin and Mani (NPCs) and explains thay are trapped inside a video game. Then the level "resets" and Sam finds himself in <strong>Level 2</strong>.</p>
        <h3>‚öôMechanics</h3>
        <p>The player can attack using a "cat scratch" attack.</p>
        <p>Player can move left, right and jump.</p>
        <h4><strong>Level 2 - 3D FPS *Sci-Fi Alien Ship</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sam has a shotgun</li>
            <li>Summer gives you tasks (some are fake)</li>
            <li>Message: "You don't know who you can trust"</li>
            <li>Shot in the back after finding Erin and Mani ‚Üí Reset</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>üïπLevel Design</h3>
        <p>Summer gives Sam a task which requires him to upload a file onto a computer. The spaceship they are on has been breached by aliens and Sam is provided with a shotgun to kill them. When Sam reaches the computer, he comes across a strange message <i>"Be careful who you trust"</i>. After using the terminal, Summer is behind Sam and says another area of the ship has been breached and Sam needs to kill all the enemies in that area. Once Sam enters the room, he gets shot and the game "resets" again.</p>
        <h3>‚öôMechanics</h3>
        <p>The player has a shotgun.</p>
        <p><strong>Fake tasks:</strong> These are tasks that Summer gives to Sam, but their either: <br><strong>Don't actually help the mission</strong> or <br><strong>Actively make things worse</strong> - like advancing the game's corruption, leading Sam into danger.</p>
        <h4>üß™Examples of Fake Tasks:</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><strong>Tasks Given by Summer</strong></th>

            <tr>
                <td>"Clear out the aliens in the cargo bay"</td>
                <td>‚ùåFake</td>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>This can be implemented using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>Task System</strong> (quests or objectives)</li>
            <li>A <strong> Choice Tracker</strong> (did Sam follow Summer blindly or not?)</li>
            <li>A few <strong>alternative paths</strong> in the level - if Sam doesn't follow Summer's instructions, he finds new routes or truths.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Level 3 - Dating-Sim</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Visual novel style UI</li>
            <li>Talk to Summer, Erin and Mani</li>
            <li>Creepy elements start to show</li>
            <li>Character glitch</li>
            <li>Reset after a major dialogue twist</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>üïπLevel Design</h3>
        <p>"Create your own character" but the mechanic doesn't work leaving you as Sam.<br>Erin starts off talking to Sam and says he needs to get out there and start dating.</p>
        <p>As you progress, things begin to subtly glitch, characters repeat phrases with unnatural smiles, and the game seems to be trying too hard to make you <i>stay</i>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Background music occasionally slows down or reverses briefly.</li>
            <li>Dialogue choices that look normal, but act differently when selected.</li>
            <li>Save files corrupting or "duplicating" themselves</li>
            <li>Summer begins to show up in scenes she shouldn't be in, just watching silently.</li>
            <li>Mani and Erin will subtly say things like "help me"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some dialogue options Sam can say will be like asking Mani or Erin to remember who they are and unsettling things will start to worsen.</p>
        <p>The level ends when Sam says to Mani who she actually is, Mani acts confused. Erin says <i>"What are you doing? Just play the game"</i> then evil Summer flashes on the screen and the level resets.</p>
        <h3>‚öôMechanics</h3>
        <p>Visual Novel Mechanics <i>(Pick between dialogue options)</i></p>
        <h4><strong>Level 4 - 3D Survival Horror</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Dark, tense facility</li>
            <li>Avoid monster versions of Summer</li>
            <li>Upload a file ‚Üí triggers chase by corrupted Summer</li>
            <li>Get caught ‚Üí long fade to black ‚Üí reset</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>üïπLevel Design</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dark, grainy visuals with a VHS or CRT overlay</li>
            <li>Sound design: Distant footsteps, static bursts, breathing that isn't the players, faint whispers in reversed audio</li>
            <li>Occasional "flash" moments: the screen cuts to a distorted face for a fram or two, corrupted dialogue boxes etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>‚öôMechanics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exploration-based horror:</strong> The player moves slowly, flashlight-style</li>
            <li>Limited visibility, solve puzzles to progress (e.g. find a key, repair a circuit, hide from a threat)</li>
            <li>No weapons = pure tension</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Goal:</strong></h3>
        <p>The player is trying to reach a distorted version of a "Save Room" to escape. When they get there, they find a broken save file with only one option: <strong>"Stay"</strong>. Doing so pulls them into a chase sequence with Summer.</p>
        <h4><strong>Level 5 - Pixel RPG Boss Fight</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Cute visuals again, but something's off</li>
            <li>Boss fight with "Happy Summer"</li>
            <li>Free "real" Summer in cage</li>
            <li>Use potion to save Mani and Erin</li>
            <li>Final twist: maybe they never escape</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>üïπLevel Design</h3>
        <p><strong>After the Chase:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The screen goes black.</li>
            <li>Long pause.</li>
            <li>Then - <strong>the game boots back up</strong> with a cheerful jingle. It's all bubbly and colourful like a classic SNES-era platformer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>New Level Concept: "Sunny Skies & Smiles"</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>Premise:</strong>You‚Äôre suddenly playing a super cute top-down adventure game with pastel graphics, a bouncy soundtrack, and cheerful NPCs. The player character now has a big happy face and wobbly cartoon limbs. It‚Äôs like <i>Kirby meets Animal Crossing</i>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Npcs say thigns like <i>"What a beautiful day to forget everything scary!</i> or <i>"You look like you've seen a ghost - hehe"</i></li>
            <li>There's a collectable mechanic - flowers & stars.</li>
            <li>Tutorials pop up as if it's the first level.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Sutble Weirdness Creeps In (Again):</strong></h4>
        <p>After letting the player "breathe":</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One flower has blood on it.</strong> Since flowers are a collectible item, the player will find one with blood.</li>
            <li>An NPC repeats a sentence but the expression doesn't change.</li>
            <li>The background music glitches for a beat.</li>
            <li>A random NPC starts using lines from the horror level.</li>
            <li>If you pause the game, the menu flickers and briefly shows the word <strong><i>"STAY."</i></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After travelling through the level and reaching the town hall, inside, Sam will find Summer, Mani and Erin. Mani and Erin look like the life has been drained from them and Summer looks angry with Sam. A boss fight is then triggered and is similar to a <i>pokemon</i> RPG, turn-based combat style.</p>
        <h3>‚öôMechanics</h3>
        <h4>Boss Fight:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Copperhead Combo</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Special</li>
            <li>Sam's ginger hair attacks the enemy.</li>
            <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Heavy fire combo damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual:</strong> A quick cutscene-style attack with comedic one-liners.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Sunburn Smack</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Basic Attack</li>
            <li>"You ever try going outside without sunscreen?"</li>
            <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Deals light fire damage with a chance to cause burn.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual:</strong> A slap that leaves a glowing red handprint. The enemy winces in UV pain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>What This Taught Me:</strong></h2> 
        <p>Although, this project remains unfinished, the development process taught me a great deal about Unity, prototyping, and game design fundamentals. I focused primarily on building the first level, which was a 2D platformer.<br>Here's what I accomplished and learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unity Fundamentals:</strong> I became comfortable navigating Unity's interface and working with core features like GameObjects, Rigidbody2D, and BoxColliders.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Game Physics:</strong> I implemented gravity, jumping, and player movement using a custom <i><strong>PlayerMovementScript.cs</strong></i>, gaining an understanding of physics interactions and scripting.</li>
            <li><strong>Enemy AI Prototyping:</strong> I created basic AI behaviours using placeholder sprites:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Green cube = Player</li>
                <li>Blue cubes = patrolling/chasing dogs</li>
                <li>Red cubes = mice</li>
                <li>Pink cube = Summer(NPC)</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>NPC Interaction System:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduced Summer as an NPC with basic dialogue.</li>
                <li>Implemented UI that shows "Press E to interact" when the player is in range.</li>
                <li>Triggered dialogue through input detection and proximity checks.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Scripting Patrol and Chase Logic:</strong> I scripted simple patrol patterns for enemies and implemented a chase mechanic using distance checks and direction logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Modular Level Design:</strong> I used basic tile-like cubes and templates to mock up the environment and test gameplay ideas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While the project was not finished, it gabe me valuable hands-on experience with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing and organising C# scripts</li>
            <li>Testing and debugging movement mechanics</li>
            <li>Using colliders and triggers for interaction</li>
            <li>Designing gameplay logic through modular prototyping.</li>
            <li>The basic of scripting AI behaviours and player-NPC interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The early prototype served as a strong foundation and confidence builder, preparing me for more polished future projects and developing this project further.</p>
