            <h1><u>‚öôDeveloping The Story</u></h1>
            
            <h2><strong>Premise & Goal</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sam rescues friends (shaylas)</strong> (Mani, Erin and Summer) who are trapped in the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Escape the game</strong> (but there's a catch - maybe escaping means something dangerous will happen or it will erase someone important)</li>
                <li><strong>Solve the mystery</strong> of the games creator or what caused the game to malfunction leading to Sams entrapment.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2><strong>Characters and Motivation</strong></h2>
            <p>Develop Sam's relationships with his friends</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sam's role:</strong> is he the hero who will save everyone or does he have doubts and insecurities</li>
                <li><strong>Erin, Mani and Summer:</strong> What are their personalities like in this world? Do they need rescueing or do they have their own objectives and quests that intersect with Sam's?</li>
                <li><strong>The villain:</strong> who or what is behind the digital trap? Is it corrupted AI, a vengeful hacker, or even someone Sam knows who's turned against him? The antagonists motivations should drive much of the conflict.</li>
            <p>Each character could have their own story arc, and Sam could make decisions that affect their fates.</p>
            </ul>
            
            <h2><strong>Story Beats and Structure</strong></h2>
            <ol>
                <li></strong>Introduction:</strong> Sam wakes up in the digital world and learns the basic rules (what he can and can't do)</li>
                <li><strong>First mission:</strong> Maybe Sam learns that he has to find a key item (like the crystal) which leads him to the first big choice/twist</li>
                <li><strong>Rising Tension:</strong> Introduce conflicts like encounters with enemies, challenges or strange phenomena that make Sam doubt what's real. Surreal/dream-like sequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Midpoint:</strong> Sam learns something huge: maybe his friends are not as they seem or there is a darker force at play.</li>
                <li><strong>Climax:</strong> A final confrontation or series of choices that will determine who gets out and what happens to the world Sam is in.</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The outcome of the story based on player choices. Do they escape? What happens to their friendships? Do they uncover the truth?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2><strong>Themes & Conflict</strong></h2>
            <p>Every story needs conflict. Develop <strong>internal conflict</strong> such as Sam's doubts, fear of failure etc. as well as <strong>external conflicts</strong> such as the vilain, the broken game world, or dangerous enemies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Conflicts:</strong> Sam could struggle with doubts about whether he's even capable of saving his friends or whether he'll be trapped forever.</li>
            <li><strong>Game World Conflicts:</strong> The digital world itself could have glitches or unpredictable events, like the appearance of strange NPCs or dangerous creatues that seem to be controlled by something - or someone-else.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Atmosphere</strong></h2>
        <p>A strong atmosphere can make a text-based game feel immersive. Use descriptive writing to bring the world to life. Describe the <strong>digital environment</strong>‚Äîis it a mix of familiar and strange elements? Maybe some places look like normal game worlds, while others are glitchy and corrupted.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>Plot Framework</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>The Digital Trap:</strong> Sam, an average gamer, gets sucked into a game while playing. At first, it's a dream come true, but he soon realises that he's not alone - his friends, Mani, Erin and Summer are also trapped, each in different parts of the game world. They've been changed by the game, some of them for the better, and some for the worst.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Objectives:</strong> Sam has to uncover why he's stuck in the game and how to free his friends. Along the way, he discovers that the game's creator, a mysterious figure, is hiding secrets and manipulating the world around him.</li>
            <li><strong>Plot Twists:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Some characters may have hidden motives (Summer, who seems sweet, is hiding a dark secret).</li>
                <li>Sam discovers a choice that could free him, but it may cause something worse to happen to his friends.</li>
                <li>The game's world is unstable, and it's clear that the reality Sam's trying to escape might be more dangerous than staying trapped.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Opening Scene:</strong> Sam is sucked into the game while playing on his computer. He wakes up in a glowing forest, disorientated and confused.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial Quest:</strong> Sam meets an NPC (a mysterious guide) who explains that he's trapped in a digitala world. His friends have also been pulled into the game but are scattered across different areas. He must rescue them and escape.</li>

            <section id="act2">
            <h1><strong>Act 2: Saving His Friends</strong></h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Erin's Level:</strong> Erin is trapped in a dark, spooky dungeon, fitting her love for drawing and humerous personality. The challenges here are to solve puzzles that involve creativity and drawing, or navigating through illusions Erin would love to prank Sam with.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dialogue Example:</strong> Sam could be reunited with Erin in this eerie setting. Maybe she‚Äôs being held by a glitchy creature or something, and when Sam finds her, Erin might joke: <i>‚ÄúOh, hey, Sam! Took you long enough! Did you get lost in the spooky fog or just want to take in the view?‚Äù</i></li>
                </ul>
                
                <li><strong>Mani's Level:</strong> Mani could be in a digital city or an area filled with futuristic tech, since she‚Äôs a gamer and a video editor. There could be puzzles related to hacking into systems or fighting through rogue AI. The humor could come in the form of Mani giving Sam advice in video-game lingo or sarcastic comments.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dialogue Example:</strong> When Sam finds Mani, she might say something like: <i>‚ÄúAbout time you showed up! I‚Äôve been editing this mess of code for hours. I almost hacked my way out of here, but figured I‚Äôd wait for my hero.‚Äù</i></li>
                </ul>

                <li><strong>Summer's Level:</strong>Summer, as a cute anime girl, could be in a vibrant, fantasy world that‚Äôs reminiscent of an anime-style game or realm. This could be a more magical level, filled with whimsy and strange characters. The challenge here could involve a lot of charm-based interactions, or helping magical creatures.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dialogue Example:</strong> When Sam finds Summer, she might act a little mysterious: <i>‚ÄúSam... You‚Äôre here. But I knew you would be. You‚Äôre the key, after all. Now, let‚Äôs see if you can unlock the next part of the puzzle!‚Äù</i></li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Boss Level:</strong> After rescuing everyone, Sam discovers that the true villain is the game's creator (or an AI gone rogue), and now the friends have to band together to defeat this entity in a massive digital showdown.</li>
                <li><strong>Climactic Dialogue</strong> As they face off against the villain, each friend could contribute with their unique traits and skills. Sam could have moments where he has to make difficult choices that affect the outcome of the battle, or influence the fate of the digital world.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> As the final battle nears, Sam could say:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>‚ÄúAlright, guys. This is it. We beat this thing together, or we stay trapped in this mess forever.‚Äù</li>
                        <li><strong>Erin:</strong> ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be stuck in here with you guys than face the real world alone. Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù</li>
                        <li><strong>Mani:</strong> ‚ÄúYou think you can glitch your way out of this? Not on my watch!‚Äù</li>
                        <li><strong>Summer:</strong> ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs finish this, Sam! You‚Äôre not alone, remember that.‚Äù</li>

            <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
            <h3><strong>What This Taught Me:</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The use of a Scene class shows how to structure game elements logically by grouping descriptions, options, and actions together. This reinforces the importance of organizing game elements as objects in a way that is reusable and easy to modify.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>By asking the player to make choices through console input, the project highlights the importance of gathering user input, validating it, and executing corresponding actions. This is key in making interactive games.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Event-driven Programming:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The actions in each scene are tied to user choices, triggering corresponding events. It teaches how events can drive the flow of a game, with the player‚Äôs actions directly affecting the story.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Game Flow Control:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game includes a basic loop that continues until an "ending" condition is met, teaching how to manage game progression and multiple possible outcomes. This can be expanded for more complex branching narratives.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Game Structure and Branching:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>The branching storylines where each choice leads to a new scene provide insight into building more complex narrative structures, a crucial aspect of storytelling in games.</li></ul>
                <li><strong>Reusibility and Code Organisation:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>The code is structured in a way that new scenes and actions can be easily added, reinforcing the importance of modular programming for future expansion and scalability.</li></ul>
            </ol>
            <h3><strong>Why It's Valuable Despite Being a Small Project:</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Understanding Core Game Development Concepts:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>Even though the project is small and text-based, it teaches core concepts used in game development, such as handling input, branching logic, and implementing multiple outcomes based on player choices.</li></ul>
            <li><strong>Simplified Approach to Interactive Storytelling:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>This project serves as an introduction to interactive storytelling where player choices matter, providing a foundation for more complex visual novels or decision-based games.</li></ul>
            <li><strong>Scalability and Extendibility:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>Although it‚Äôs a simple, unfinished prototype, this project could easily be extended with additional scenes, options, and a richer story, showing potential for future growth.</li></ul>
            <li><strong>Practical Use of C#:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>The project demonstrates the application of C# in a game development context, where classes, methods, and actions interact dynamically, enhancing understanding of how coding can be used for fun, interactive experiences.</li></ul>
            <p>This project is a practical exercise in creating interactive experiences using code and shows that even small, unfinished projects can teach key concepts that are transferable to larger game development efforts. It‚Äôs a good demonstration of problem-solving, creativity, and technical skills that are applicable to real-world game development.</p>
